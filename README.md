# Machine Learning Algorithms
***
One of the best ways to truly understand a machine learning algorithm is to code it from scratch. The purpose if this repo is to maintain the projects that I have completed recreating various machine learning algorithms.

The repo includes the Jupyter Notebooks and Python scripts for the following machine learning algorithms:
1.	Naive Bayes
2.	KNN
